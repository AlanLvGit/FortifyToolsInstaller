This utility will install and optionally run various Fortify tools that are commonly used in CI/CD pipelines

Usage:
  ./FortifyToolsInstaller.sh <-h|--help>
  [options] source ./FortifyToolsInstaller.sh
  [options] source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortify/FortifyToolsInstaller/latest/FortifyToolsInstaller.sh)
  [options] source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortify/FortifyToolsInstaller/<version|branch>/FortifyToolsInstaller.sh)

Note that as a best practice, you may want to verify the integrity of the script before executing it
from a remote location, for example by running sha256sum on the downloaded script and comparing this
with a known SHA256 hash.

[options] is a set of variable definitions. Variables must be specified in either lower case or uppercase
case; mixed case variables will not be recognized. Tool aliases are case-insensitive. The following options
are recognized by this tool:

  FTI_TOOLS=<toolAlias1[:toolVersion]>[,<toolAlias2>[:version][,...]
    Required: Define one or more tool aliases and optional tool versions to be installed
    Example: FTI_TOOLS=sc,fu:latest,fve:v1.4.1
    Supported tools, their aliases and default versions:
      ScanCentralClient
        Aliases: ScanCentralClient, ScanCentral, sc
        Default version: latest
      FoDUploader
        Aliases: FoDUploader, FoDUpload, fu
        Default version: latest
      FortifyVulnerabilityExporter
        Aliases: FortifyVulnerabilityExporter, fve
        Default version: latest

  FTI_FORCE_INSTALL=true|1
    Force tools to be re-downloaded and installed even if they are already installed

  FTI_DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECK=true|1
    Disable integrity check for downloaded tools. It is recommended to leave integrity checks
    enabled; also see <toolAlias|toolName>_SHA256 below. Note that hashes for 'latest' versions
    may change whenever a new tool version is released, which will cause the integrity check to
    fail until this script has been updated with the correct hash.

  FTI_VARS_OUT=export|verify
    If set to 'export' (default), output variables will be exported to the shell environment.
    The 'verify' option is useful when building docker images, to verify that the Dockerfile
    contains ENV instructions that match the output variables of FortifyToolsInstaller.

  FORTIFY_HOME=</path/to/fortify.home>
    Override Fortify home directory, defaults to ~/.fortify

  FORTIFY_TOOLS_HOME=</path/to/fortify/tools/dir>
    Override Fortify tools directory, defaults to <FORTIFY_HOME>/tools
    Tools will be installed to <FORTIFY_TOOLS_HOME>/<toolName>/<toolVersion>

  <toolAlias|toolName>_HOME=</path/to/tool/installation/directory>
    Override installation directory for the given tool name or alias, defaults to
    <FORTIFY_TOOLS_HOME>/<toolName>/<toolVersion>

  <toolAlias|toolName>_SHA256=<SHA256 for given tool name being installed>
    Override SHA256 hash for the given tool alias or name, for the version specified in the
    FTI_TOOLS variable. This may be useful in case this script hasn't been updated yet with
    hashes for new tool versions.

  SCANCENTRAL_CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>
  SC_CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>
    Optional ScanCentral client authentication token to be stored in client.properties
