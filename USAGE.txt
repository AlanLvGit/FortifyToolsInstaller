This utility will install and optionally run various Fortify tools that are commonly used in CI/CD pipelines

Usage:
  [options] ./FortifyToolsInstaller.sh [-h|--help]
  [options] source <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortify/FortifyToolsInstaller/main/FortifyToolsInstaller.sh)

[options] is a set of variable definitions. Variables must be specified in either lower case or uppercase
case; mixed case variables will not be recognized. Tool aliases are case-insensitive. The following options
are recognized by this tool:

  FTI_TOOLS=<toolAlias1[:toolVersion]>[,<toolAlias2>[:version][,...]
    Required: Define one or more tool aliases and optional tool versions to be installed and/or run
              If corresponding FTI_RUN_<toolAlias> or FTI_<toolAlias>_ARGS have been defined, the
              tool will be installed (if necessary) and then run immediately. Otherwise, the tool
              will be installed for later use, without actually running it.
    Example: FTI_TOOLS=sc,fu:latest,fve:v1.4.1
    Supported tools, their aliases and default versions:
